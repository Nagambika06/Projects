                <h2>Missile man of india</h2>
                <p><b>Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam </b>was born on 15 October 1931, to a Tamil Muslim family in
                    the
                    pilgrimage centre of Rameswaram on Pamban Island, then in the Madras Presidency and now in the State
                    of Tamil Nadu. His father Jainulabdeen Marakayar was a boat owner and imam of a local mosque; his
                    mother Ashiamma was a housewife.His father owned a ferry that took Hindu pilgrims
                    back and forth between Rameswaram and the now uninhabited Dhanushkodi. Kalam was the
                    youngest of four brothers and one sister in his family. His ancestors had been wealthy
                    Marakayar traders and landowners, with numerous properties and large tracts of land. Marakayar are a
                    Muslim ethnic group found in coastal Tamil Nadu and Sri Lanka who claim descent from Arab traders
                    and local women. The family business had involved trading groceries between the mainland and the
                    island and to and from Sri Lanka, as well as ferrying pilgrims between the mainland and Pamban. With
                    the opening of the Pamban Bridge to the mainland in 1914, however, the businesses failed and the
                    family fortune and properties were lost by the 1920s, apart from the ancestral home. The family was
                    poverty-stricken by the time Kalam was born. As a young boy he had to sell newspapers to add to the
                    family's meager income.
